Read about this project on my blog: http://reganmian.net/blog/2010/04/29/personal-time-tracker-with-ruby-and-growl/

Inspired by this New York Times article: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html

This was developed by Stian HÃ¥klev, shaklev@gmail.com, using a few snippets from other sources. I release
it under Public Domain. But feel free to share any modifications. 

TODO:
- deal with midnight-switch
- script that processes timestamp files and spits out lists of activities (what format?)
- the ideal thing would be to find existing software/website set up to analyze this data, rather than to do it ourselves 
  (can spit out in whatever format is desired, pretty much)
